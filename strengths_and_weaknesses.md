# Strengths
1. Tracks the changes of documents and therefore creates a version history.
2. Git allows collaboration between multiple people working on the same project/files where everyone can test their own stuff and merge it with the work of others once they are done.
# Weaknesses
1. It takes up additional storage.
2. Git struggles to track changes of certain document types, such as pdfs and they therefor should be added to the list of files to be ignored by git.
